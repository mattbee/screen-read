# Screen read

Practice using a screen reader and find your way around the page.

There are also a number of poorly developed parts of the website to demonstrate how poor the experience for a screen reader user can be.

Use your chosen screen reader either in 'blind mode' or in normal sighted mode to see if you can complete all the challenges (and mark any that you think are not possible due to a poorly developed component).

## Blind mode

Blind mode will only show you focussable elements on the page.
