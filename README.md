# Screen read

Practice using a screen reader and find your way around the page.

## Challenges

The challenges will not be read out using a screen reader by default as this website is only focussed on helping people unfamiliar with a screen reader to use one for testing.

Use your chosen screen reader either in 'blind mode' or in normal 'sighted mode' to see if you can complete all the challenges.

## Blind mode

Blind mode will replace the visible area of the website with a VoiceOver help screen, meaning you can get help using VoiceOver whilst also obscuring the screen to stop you cheating!
