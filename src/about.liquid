<h1>About Screen read</h1>

<p>This is just a pretend site with things I can control which is being used to help people learn how screen readers work.</p>

<p>The challenges set on this site are to help people learn to navigate all manner of content with a screen reader and highlight the importance of good, clean HTML.</p>

<p>It's built with the <a href="https://www.11ty.io">Eleventy static site generator</a> and the you can see the <a href="https://github.com/mattbee/screen-read">code on Github</a></p>
